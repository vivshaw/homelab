# Terraform config

## Running

You'll need to first ensure [the VM images have been generated by Packer](../packer/README.md), then provide Proxmox auth credentials in `credentials.tfvars`. Then:

```shell
terraform plan -var-file=credentials.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=credentials.tfvars
```

If you've already run this, and wish to re-create the templates after some changes, another `terraform apply` may not do the trick- it has a tendency to hang. Try a `terraform destroy` followed by a fresh `terraform apply`.

## Miscellany

See [`NOTES.md`](./NOTES.md) for miscellaneous notes and learnings I ran across along the way.
